        <p>
          This is a III/IV IT - B ML Lab project demonstrating how
          <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> and
          <strong>Deep Learning (DL)</strong> can be used for
          <em>automatic skin disease detection</em> from images.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Machine Learning (Dataset A)</h5>
        <p class="small">
          Classical ML models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) are
          trained on a tabular feature dataset. In this project, the features
          are handcrafted image descriptors such as color histograms extracted
          from the skin images.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Deep Learning (Dataset B)</h5>
        <p class="small">
          Deep learning models (a custom CNN and a ResNet18 transfer learning
          model) are trained directly on raw skin images. Convolutional layers
          learn complex patterns and textures related to different skin
          conditions.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Evaluation</h5>
        <p class="small">
          Both ML and DL models are evaluated using standard metrics:
        </p>
        <ul class="small">
          <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: percentage of correct predictions.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Precision</strong>: among predicted positives, how many are
            truly positive?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recall</strong>: among true positives, how many did we
            detect?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>F1-score</strong>: harmonic mean of precision and recall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong>: shows per-class performance and
            common misclassifications.
          </li>
        </ul>
